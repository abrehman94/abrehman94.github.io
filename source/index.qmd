# Abdul Rehman 

Ph.D. student with over eight years of experience in systems research (two years) and software development (six years). 
I have worked on a wide range of projects, from firmware to cloud computing. 
Notable contributions include UEFI graphics driver development, NVMe virtualization, and my recent work on custom Linux CPU scheduling for a serverless platform. 
I have extensive experience writing Rust, eBPF, Python, and C code.

I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the guidance of [Prateek Sharma](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~prateeks) at Indiana University Bloomington.

# Research Focus

I am working on tightly integrating the [serverless platform](https://github.com/COS-IN/iluvatar-faas) with CPU scheduling 
beyond the conventional control group interface. 
The conventional approach overlooks microsecond-scale issues such as neighbor effects and cache pollution. 
By revamping the interface with shared eBPF maps and custom scheduling domain construction, 
the control plane can continue making coarse-grained adjustments while a custom scheduler addresses these finer-grained performance challenges. 
This has been made possible by the recently introduced [sched_ext](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx) framework in Linux 6.12.

# About Me 

I enjoy hiking and driving. I run three miles three times a week.
I find solace in coding and reading.
I can't help but ask questionsâ€”I'm curious about everything.
Oh boy, it can get you into trobule!

<!--
I love to spend time with my family, driving and hiking.
I run three miles three times a week.
I like to sit staring at a tree for long hours, thinking about how each molecule of air works together to move energy from one place to another, moving the leaves in a way that can be mathematically determined yet seems so undeterministic.
How we are no different from a fish living in a sea, witnessing the same effect of energy on a seaweed, yet different enough to reason about it and develop such a deep understanding of it, so much so that we can use it for a completely different purpose.
