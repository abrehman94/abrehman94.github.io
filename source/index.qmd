# Abdul Rehman

Ph.D. student with 8+ years of systems software development (6 years of full time industrial position) 
and systems research (2 years) experience. 
During my time in industry I have worked on UEFI firmware, Nucleus RTOS and NVMe virtualization.

For past two years, my focus has been on serverless computing, linux scheduling and Machine Learning. 
I have added Rust, eBPF and deep learning approach using pyTorch to my toolbox. 
I am working under the guidance of [Prateek Sharma](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~prateeks) at Indiana University Bloomington.

I enjoy diving deep into complex problems, trying to find the last ounce of performance boost in myraid of interconnected components.

# Research Focus

Currently, I am trying to improve the performance of a 
[serverless platform](https://github.com/COS-IN/iluvatar-faas) 
using eBPF based [sched_ext](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx) framework to implement custom scheduling policy that would 
take advantage of the historical characteristics of the serverless functions, tight coupling with the control plane and 
machine learning.

# About Me 

I love to spend time with my family, driving and hiking.
I run three miles three times a week.
I like to sit staring at a tree for long hours, thinking about how each molecule of air works together to move energy from one place to another, moving the leaves in a way that can be mathematically determined yet seems so undeterministic.
How we are no different from a fish living in a sea, witnessing the same effect of energy on a seaweed, yet different enough to reason about it and develop such a deep understanding of it, so much so that we can use it for a completely different purpose.
