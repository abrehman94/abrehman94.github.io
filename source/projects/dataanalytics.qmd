## Overview 

[Github Repository](https://github.com/abrehman94/Edge-IoT-Analytics-Box)

Edge-IoT-Analytics-Box is a data analytics system that captures and analyzes data in real time. 
The system is designed to be deployed on edge devices like Jetson Orin.

## Performance Results  

For 54 sensors being predicted using arima model and RNN model

  * Network bandwidth consumption on Jetson ~800 Kbytes per sec
  * CPU utilization on Jetson ~25 %
  * GPU utilization ~40 %
  * InfluxDB storage increases by ~7 Kbytes per second
    * it would take 866 days to fill up 500 Gb of space which is ~2.3 years

Please see [report](https://github.com/abrehman94/Edge-IoT-Analytics-Box/blob/main/docs/performance_analysis/report.pdf) for more details.

## Repository Layout    

Each module has it's own directory.

**./tserve (Torch Serve):** Contains code to deploy torch serve on Jetson Orin along with scripts for building and delploying models. 

**./analytics (Framework):** Framework to setup a data analytics pipeline using models deployed on torch serve. 

**./streaming_service (Data Fetching):** Contains code to setup data streaming from sensors to InfluxDB, including scripts to setup InfluxDB.

## Getting Started 

  * setup InfluxDB on a server using the instructions in **streaming_service/README.md**
  * once data is streaming to the DB 
    * setup torch serve on a Jetson Orin using the instructions in **tserve/README.md**
    * setup an analytics pipeline using the instructions in **analytics/README.md**
