  This lesson will introduce you to the VIM text editor. 
  VIM is a powerful text editor that is available on most UNIX systems. 
  It is a modal editor, which means that it has different modes for 
  inserting text and moving around the file. 
  This lesson will cover the basics of VIM, including how to open and 
  close files, how to navigate within a file, and how to save changes. 
  By the end of this lesson, you will be able to use VIM to create and 
  edit text files.
