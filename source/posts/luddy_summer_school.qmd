# Overview 

[Github Repository](https://github.com/abrehman94/Linux-Scripting-Tutorial)

I have created a tutorial that introduces high school students to Ubuntu 20.04, 
starting with the fundamentals of Linux using a graphical user interface (GUI) 
and progressing to the terminal environment. 
We then delve into bash scripting. 
The tutorial is designed to be interactive and hands-on, 
culminating in an exercise where students sort songs by author name.
