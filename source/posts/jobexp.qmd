    A summary of experiences as an embedded systems developer.

Most of my experience as an embedded systems developer has been focused on virtualization 
and type 1 hypervisors. 
I have had the chance to work on cutting edge hardware (at the time) Intel Embedded Processor Elkhartlake (2021) and 
reslove many interesting issues related to ACPI, AHCI-virt, NVMe-virt etc.
On the hypervisor side I really enjoyed adding support for various virtualization solutions. 

**VT-d DMAR/IOMU driver:** Added support for IOMMU driver to allow device isolation and memory remapping of the VM.  

**UEFI virtualization:** Developed infrastructure to provide virtual UEFI interface for guest VMs. 
Designed and developed caching solution for non-volatile variables to avoid SMI generation.

**Intel Graphics Device Driver(Linux-i915):** 
Ported Linux device driver (i915) for Intel Graphics Device to a UEFI driver. 
It allowed early graphics for Linux and Windows guests - stuff like splash screen and recovery mode menus. 

**NVMe virtualization:**
Contributed to the design and development of the infrastructure.
I was responsible for interrupt handling and I/O queue segregation components.
Interrupt handling component was implemented using MMIO trap and emulation of PCI MSI-X capability.
To verify the paravirtualized implementation, I modified the Linux driver for NVMe into a paravirtualized client.

**QT Framework:** Ported QT framework 5.4 to Nucleus RTOS.
